startpaused.sh :
  usage: setsid ./startpaused.sh <file> -- <cmd> <args>
  starts application paused and writes PID to <file>

pstree-icount:
usage: ./pstree-icount <pid> <us> <limit>
stop a process tree after a given number of total instructions on core 0
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<us>     :     polling time period in microseconds
<limit>  :     instruction count beyond which to stop (0 for run to completion)

pstree-pccount:
usage: ./pstree-pccount <pid> <tid> <pc> <limit>
stop a process tree at a given thread after <limit> occurrences of an instruction at <pc>
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<tid>    :     tid of the target thread
<pc>     :     instruction address of the target instruction
<limit>  :     no. of occurrences of <pc> after which to stop


pstree-timedrun 
usage: ./pstree-timedrun <pid> <us> <limit>
stop a process tree after executing for a given number of micro-seconds
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<us>     :     polling time period in microseconds
<limit>  :     no. of seconds after which to stop (0 for run to completion)
